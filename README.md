# Dog Breeds

This project uses the https://dog.ceo/ API to provide a Flutter Mobile App that lists dog breeds and their images. 
Here are some packages utilized and implementation features:

- State Pattern to control states and ValueNotifier for reactivity.
- `hive` and `cached_network_image` packages for storing favorites locally.
- The `mocktail` package for mocking repositories in unit tests.
